## Getting Started

### Use the Github template

First, click the green `Use this template` button near the top of this page. This will take you to
Github's ['Generate Repository'](https://github.com/lefticus/cpp_starter_project/generate) page. Fill in a repository
name and short description, and click 'Create repository from template'. This will allow you to create a new repository
in your Github account, prepopulated with the contents of this project. Now you can clone the project locally and get to
work!

    $ git clone https://github.com/<user>/<your_new_repo>.git
